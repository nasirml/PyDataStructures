### Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

In this repository, I will put the implementations of basic data structures and algorithms in python. You can use it as imports to your programs. For example, if you are solving problems on, say, linked list, its painful to create the linked list everytime, right? Or even at the first time when you are coming back to solve them after a while. So, you have all the basic functions of linked list (like, create the list, insert node, remove node, display the list etc.) implemented in this repo, and you just use them in your program. Use your valuable time to solve problems instead of actually creating the linked list. Happy problem solving!

### NOTES
* Algorithm **complexity or running time** is included in the comment section, most of the time.
* I try to differentiate between python list and the linked list in the comments. In case of obvious scenarios, I use them interchangeably.
